                <span class="big-bold">"Atomic Habits"</span> is a bestselling self-help book written by James Clear, aiming to guide readers on the transformative journey of building good habits and breaking bad ones.
                The book, published in 2018, combines scientific research, real-life stories, and practical strategies to provide readers with a comprehensive guide to understanding and changing their habits. The central premise of the book is that small changes, when compounded over time, lead to remarkable results. Clear introduces the concept of atomic habits, which are tiny, consistent changes that may seem insignificant at first but, when practiced consistently, can have a profound impact on one's life. The author argues that habits are the compound interest of self-improvement, and by focusing on making small improvements consistently, individuals can achieve remarkable long-term results. The book is divided into four parts, each addressing a different aspect of habits. They are:
